# Pong Multiplayer-Game

This is my first JavaScript application!<br><br>
I'm happy sharing this here.<br><br><br>

*HOW TO PLAY?*

To run p5.js in your computer you will need a text editor. You can use the
code editor of your choice. I usually use the Sublime Text 2. Other good editor
options are Brackets and Atom. If you are a screen reader user and not using the
p5 web editor, you may want to use Notepad++ or Eclipse.

After that, to play Pong with your friends is simple! <br><br>



*Player 1 (left) - Arrows UP and DOWN to move*.

*Player 2 (right) - Buttons W and S to move.*<br><br>



Hope you like and have fun!
